-- Light Messages
--
-- Light messages control and acquire the state of a specific type of device,
-- such as a lightbulb. The state is comprised of the label, power level and
-- color.
--
-- There are a duplicate set of device power related messages,
-- Device::GetPower, Device::StatePower and Device::SetPower, which are
-- extended for lights by adding a duration field to Light::SetPower.
--
-- The Protocol header message type field value (decimal) appears after each
-- message name in this document. Each section below describes the payload that
-- is appended to the message header. Some messages do not require a payload.

-- *  Message Field Data Types

-- | HSBK is used to represent the color and color temperature of a light.
--
-- The color is represented as an HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness) value.
--
-- The color temperature is represented in K (Kelvin) and is used to adjust the
-- warmness / coolness of a white light, which is most obvious when saturation
-- is close zero.
--
-- For user interface purposes, the hue is typically scaled to between 0째 and
-- 360째. Saturation and brightness are typically scaled to between 0% and 100%.
data HSBK = HSBK
  { hue :: Word16             -- Hue: range 0 to 65535
  , saturation :: Word16      -- Saturation: range 0 to 65535
  , brightness :: Word16      -- Brightness: range 0 to 65535
  , kelvin :: Word16          -- Kelvin: range 2500째 (warm) to 9000째 (cool)
